# Lab 2

In the main() function in ticTacToe.py, there are comments with four #'s that I used to make the outputs more clear because they just said 'True' and 'False' so randomly.

All they do is just say what condition it was checking, followed by if it was true or false.

It is also really messy in that function but I'm too lazy to make it look better

## Bugs

You can find each bug by searching for 'BUG HERE', should be like 'ctrl + f' or 'ctrl + h'. To be honest, I am not 100% sure if the type of bug I labelled them as are correct (unit, logic, etc.), but it matches the sample output and video output sooo

## Extra

If you want to just see the test cases, uncomment the last line in ticTacToe.py and comment the last line in ticTacToeMain (vice versa to run the actual game).

Let me know about any questions about the code or whatever, plus I did this without actually using ChatGpt
(OR if I messed up anywhere because I just finished this in like an hour and got lazy)
